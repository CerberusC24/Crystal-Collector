# Crystal-Collector
Week 2 / Unit 4 JQuery HW

<p>A simplistic matching game. The computer randomly generates a number within a predetermined range. The user must click the "appraise" button under the crystals to receive a value. If they can add up the values correctly and match the computer number, the user wins. If the user's value ends up being higher than the computer number, they lose. To make the game slightly less predictable, the values of the crystals are randomly generated from a predetermined list on each new game instance as well.</p>

<p>This game is also mobile-friendly</p>
